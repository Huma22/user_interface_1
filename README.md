Android Development 
(GeidView, Custom Adapter(Adaptor Design Pattern), ListView, WebView, Context Menu)

The main activity in the app displays a grid. Each grid cell contains a thumbnail picture of a car above the name of the car’s manufacturer. Each grid cell supports two kinds of functionality, depending on whether an app viewer performs a short vs. a long click on a cell. A short click brings up a new activity that shows the entire picture of the selected car on the entire device display. The user can return to the grid view by selecting the back soft button on the phone. However, if a user clicks on the displayed picture instead, the app opens a browser activity showing the web site of the car’s manufacturer. A long click on a grid cell brings up a context menu showing the following three options for the car under consideration: 
(1) View the entire picture 
(2) Show the official web page of the car manufacturer in a new activity 
(3) bring up a list containing the names and addresses of at least three car dealers for the selected manufacturer in greater Chicago area. When user clicks on a phone number or the address shown in the list, a phone dialer or defaul map app is opened.
